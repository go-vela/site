The schema gets published and updated via https://github.com/go-vela/types where it ends up as a release artifact. The latest schema is available for download from https://github.com/go-vela/types/releases/latest/download/schema.json.

In addition, the schema has been added to the JSON Schema Store project at https://www.schemastore.org/ which provides direct support for various editors (see "Supporting editors" section at https://www.schemastore.org/json/\).
