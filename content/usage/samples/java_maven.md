  Sample Java (With Maven) Pipeline
---

Sample [Yaml](https://yaml.org/spec/) configuration for a project building a [Java](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/) application with [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/guides/index.html).

## Scenario

User is looking to create a pipeline that builds an artifact on any event or branch pushed to source control.

### Steps

The following [pipeline concepts](/docs/concepts/pipeline) are being used in the pipeline below:

* [Steps](/docs/concepts/pipeline/steps/)
  * [image](/docs/concepts/pipeline/steps/image/)
  * [Pull](/docs/concepts/pipeline/steps/pull/)
  * [Commands](/docs/concepts/pipeline/steps/commands/)

{{% alert title="Note:" color="primary" %}}
Pipeline must be stored in base of repository as `.vela.yml` or `.vela.yaml`

It is recommended to pin `image:` versions for production pipelines
{{% /alert %}}

```yaml
version: "1"

steps:
  - name: install
    image: maven:latest
    pull: true
    commands:
      - mvn install

  - name: test
    image: maven:latest
    pull: true
    commands:
      - mvn test

  - name: build
    image: maven:latest
    pull: true
    commands:
      - mvn package
```

### Stages

The following [pipeline concepts](/docs/concepts/pipeline) are being used in the pipeline below:

* [Stages](/docs/concepts/pipeline/stages/)
  * [Needs](/docs/concepts/pipeline/needs/)
  * [Steps](/docs/concepts/pipeline/steps/)
    * [image](/docs/concepts/pipeline/steps/image/)
    * [Pull](/docs/concepts/pipeline/steps/pull/)
    * [Commands](/docs/concepts/pipeline/steps/commands/)
