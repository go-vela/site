  Sample Pipeline with build routing
---

Sample [Yaml](https://yaml.org/spec/) configuration for a project requiring a specific runtime or platform.

## Scenario

User is looking to create a pipeline that can only run within a Docker runtime.

{{% alert title="Note:" color="primary" %}}
Work with your server administer to understand what routes are available for your installation
{{% /alert %}}

### Steps

The following [pipeline concepts](/docs/concepts/pipeline) are being used in the pipeline below:

* [Worker](/docs/concepts/pipeline/worker/)
  * [Runtime](/docs/concepts/pipeline/worker/runtime/)
* [Steps](/docs/concepts/pipeline/steps/)
  * [Image](/docs/concepts/pipeline/steps/image/)
  * [Pull](/docs/concepts/pipeline/steps/pull/)
  * [Commands](/docs/concepts/pipeline/steps/commands/)

{{% alert title="Note:" color="primary" %}}
Pipeline must be stored in base of repository as `.vela.yml` or `.vela.yaml`

It is recommended to pin `image:` versions for production pipelines
{{% /alert %}}

```yaml
version: "1"

worker:
  runtime: docker

steps:
  - name: view worker name
    image: alpine:latest
    pull: true
    commands:
      - echo "Hello ${BUILD_HOST} Worker!!"
```
