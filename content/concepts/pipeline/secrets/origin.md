The `origin` component is a part of a [secret](/docs/concepts/pipeline/secrets/) for Vela.

This declaration allows you to pull secrets from non-internal secret providers via plugins.

  # Implicit secret definition.
  - name: vault_token

+  - origin:
+     name: vault external secrets
+     image: target/secret-vault
+     secrets: [ vault_token ]
+     parameters:
+       addr: vault.company.com

+       username: octocat
+       items:
+         - source: secret/vela
