Vela is a Pipeline Automation (CI/CD) framework built on Linux container technology written in Golang.

Vela uses a syntax similar to Docker Compose to define its configuration. This structure for repeated use, within the application, is called a pipeline and a single execution of a pipeline is referenced as a build.

We use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to format and generate our website, the [Docsy](https://github.com/google/docsy) theme for styling and site structure. Thanks!
